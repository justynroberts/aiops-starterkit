# AIops Starter Kit

**PagerDuty AIops starter kit** _A 2023 Hackweek project by Justyn Roberts (jroberts@pagerduty.com) & Constant Fischer(cfischer@pagerduty.com)_

## Core Goals

-   To help customers quickly deploy sample Automation Actions within their AiOps environment.
-   To showcase and stimulate thinking around what's possible.
-   To help drive lower resolution times by introducing Automation early.

## Deployment Methods

The application utilizes the PagerDuty API to deploy a number of sample Automation Actions. These can be scoped to one or more services and assigned to a runner, the component hosted within a customer environment. Learn more about the runner [here](https://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/dispatch/runners/).

The application is designed to run either:

-   Standalone
-   As a Docker image via docker-compose or directly from the container repository

It could be easily deployed on a website (or Github repo).

## Core Technologies

-   PagerDuty API
-   Python 3
-   Flask

The actions are contained in the configuration directory and can be easily modified.

## Prerequisites

you MUST have a runner installed as per https://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/dispatch/runners/
